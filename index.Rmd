## Predicting prices

The web application may be consulted in [here](https://albertomacias.shinyapps.io/predicting_prices/). 

The purpose of this application is that people that want to sell their car, can compute an approximated price depending on a few variables. The variables that are being used are:

- Age of the car  
- Fuel Type  
- Kilometers Driven  
- Transmission  
- Seller Type  
- Number of previous owners  

The data for this project was downloaded from Kaggle and may be consulted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho).

## Model used

For this project, first was considered a linear regression model but because of the poor performance was considered a random forest regression.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
app_data <- read.csv("./data/car data.csv")
app_data <- app_data %>% mutate(age = 2021-Year) %>%
            select(Present_Price, age, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type,
                   Seller_Type, Transmission, Owner)
app_data <- na.omit(app_data)
model <- train(Present_Price~., data = app_data, method="rf",
                      trControl = trainControl("cv", number = 3))
```

The process of the exploratory data analysis and the model selection may be consulted in my [github repository](https://github.com/albert2828/coursera_ddp_final_project).
